Discord is a popular platform for communities, but server management often requires technical knowledge or familiarity with structured commands. The proposed solution bridges this gap by integrating natural language processing (NLP) with the Discord API to create a bot capable of interpreting and executing user requests in plain English.\n","\n","The bot will handle tasks such as creating text or voice channels, managing role permissions, and organizing server settings. For example, a user could input, \"Create a voice channel visible only to members with the 'friends' role,\" and the bot would parse the request and perform the action autonomously. This involves designing an NLP pipeline to extract intent and entities from user input and mapping them to API functions.\n","\n","The project combines deep learning models for NLP with rule-based parsing to balance accuracy and efficiency. It also incorporates robust error handling to address invalid or ambiguous inputs. The result is a highly accessible and user-friendly tool for server administrators.\n","\n","By applying deep learning to practical API interaction, this project demonstrates the potential of AI in simplifying complex workflows and improving user experience in digital platforms."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":145,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":10874,"status":"ok","timestamp":1740440052959,"user":{"displayName":"דניאל כהן","userId":"09843425876213038656"},"user_tz":480},"id":"kZUqsmEkchQc","outputId":"9cdef0bc-2ecd-491b-b14d-69dd47264715"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Requirement already satisfied: discord in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (2.3.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: discord.py>=2.3.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from discord) (2.5.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: aiohttp<4,>=3.7.4 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from discord.py>=2.3.2->discord) (3.11.12)\n","Requirement already satisfied: aiohappyeyeballs>=2.3.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from aiohttp<4,>=3.7.4->discord.py>=2.3.2->discord) (2.4.6)\n","Requirement already satisfied: aiosignal>=1.1.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from aiohttp<4,>=3.7.4->discord.py>=2.3.2->discord) (1.3.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: attrs>=17.3.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from aiohttp<4,>=3.7.4->discord.py>=2.3.2->discord) (25.1.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: frozenlist>=1.1.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from aiohttp<4,>=3.7.4->discord.py>=2.3.2->discord) (1.5.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: multidict<7.0,>=4.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from aiohttp<4,>=3.7.4->discord.py>=2.3.2->discord) (6.1.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: propcache>=0.2.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from aiohttp<4,>=3.7.4->discord.py>=2.3.2->discord) (0.2.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: yarl<2.0,>=1.17.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from aiohttp<4,>=3.7.4->discord.py>=2.3.2->discord) (1.18.3)\n","Requirement already satisfied: idna>=2.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from yarl<2.0,>=1.17.0->aiohttp<4,>=3.7.4->discord.py>=2.3.2->discord) (3.10)\n","Requirement already satisfied: python-dotenv in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (1.0.1)\n"]}],"source":["!pip install discord\n","!pip install python-dotenv"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":146,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":2197,"status":"ok","timestamp":1740440055168,"user":{"displayName":"דניאל כהן","userId":"09843425876213038656"},"user_tz":480},"id":"aOBBKy45hVhk","outputId":"6a2dabba-dedb-409a-8f4f-ad43fe33d6c6"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/drive\", force_remount=True).\n"]}],"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":147,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":14,"status":"ok","timestamp":1740440055185,"user":{"displayName":"דניאל כהן","userId":"09843425876213038656"},"user_tz":480},"id":"Eam0wJnigRtc"},"outputs":[],"source":["responses_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Discord_Manager_files/responses.ipynb'"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":148,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":22,"status":"ok","timestamp":1740440055210,"user":{"displayName":"דניאל כהן","userId":"09843425876213038656"},"user_tz":480},"id":"hLx71PWomFwc","outputId":"76b0099a-d270-44f5-b73f-3ddec3fc4d0b"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Script found!\n"]}],"source":["import os\n","if os.path.exists(responses_path):\n","    print(\"Script found!\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"Script not found.
